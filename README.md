## Introduction ##

JUMPlib is a specialized tool designed for searching TMT-based proteomics data. The JUMPlib program enables TMT library generation, database search, identification filtering, and protein quantification. To evaluate the performance of the JUMPlib program, we conducted an assessment using a large-scale TMT data set. In addition, the JUMPlib program can readily be adapted for label-free library generation and database search. Moreover, we curated comprehensive 11-plex and 18-plex TMT libraries from human brain samples, providing valuable resources to the research community.

## Basic Installation ##
The installation is tested in the linux system and HPC servers but this should work properly in windows and mac too. We highly recommend installing JUMPspecLib in a virtual environment, for example using the anaconda or miniconda package manager
1. Create a virtual enviroment and install required packages.

Here are some commands that would create an `anaconda` python environment for
running JUMPspecLib:

```
conda create -n jumplib python=3.8
conda activate jumplib
conda install numpy pandas=1.5.3 matplotlib scipy seaborn statsmodels pyteomics rpy2
# we recommend pandas=1.5.3 particular version of pandas because the libraries were created using this version but if you are going to create your own library using JUMPspecLib you can install latest version

```

2. Place the JUMPlib distribution source in the desired location (call
this `<path to JUMPlib>`)


----

  * Obtaining JUMPspecLib source 
You can obtain the latest version of JUMPspecLib from git; simple clone the
git repository:

```
    git clone https://github.com/surPoudel/JUMPspecLib.git
```

in the directory _where you would like JUMPlib to be installed_ (call this directory `<path to JUMPlib>`).  Note
that JUMPlib does not support out-of-place installs; the JUMPlib git
repository _is_ the entire installation.

## JUMPlib Commands ##

Once the conda environment (JUMPlib) is activated

1. make a working directory
2. keep all the mzXML or mzML files in the same directory
3. copy the parameter file from [parameterFiles](./parameterFiles) to the same directory
4. make necessary changes for the parameters 
5. Run the command below

a. Library generation
```
Preprocessing 
jump_lib -pp jump_lib_preprocess.params *.mzXML/*.mzML 

Library generation
jump_lib -d jump_lib_gen.params

Library merging
jump_lib -d_merge jump_lib_specLibMerge.params
```
Note: We also provide the comprehensive TMT libraries so you may skip Library generation becasue it takes time.

b. Library searching (with presearch and without presearch)
```
jump_lib -pp jump_preprocess.params *.mzXML/*.mzML
jump_lib -s jumplib_search.params
jump_lib -pp_s jumplib_search.params
```

c. Filter the search results
```
jump_lib -f jumplib_filter.params
```

d. Quantification of filtered dataset
```
jump_lib -q jump_lib_q.params
```

## Test Data Exercise ##
#### Download [database and test data along with code/scripts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wIzRg3dC6fkEVhWwWJFfst8HwnMx8Jcn)
* This will download test_jumplib.zip
#### Libraries
* Unzip the file
  ```
  test_jumplib\test_jumplib\spectral_libraries
  ```
* Contains TMT11 and TMT18 Human brain libraries
#### Test Data 
* Go to
  ```
  test_jumplib\test_jumplib\example_data
  ```
* This folder contains a sample mzXML file along with parameter files required for search, filter and quantification
* It also has a script to wrap all at once
  ```
  bash run_jumplib.sh
  ```
